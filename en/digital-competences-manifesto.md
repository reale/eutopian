Eutopian endorses the [Digital Competences Manifesto](https://all-digital.org/manifesto/) developed by [ALL DIGITAL](https://all-digital.org/).

The Digital Competences Manifesto was first presented at the ALL DIGITAL General Assembly in May 2019, and after the extensive consultation with ALL DIGITAL members was adopted by the Board and then presented at the ALL DIGITAL Summit in Bologna on 11 October 2019.

Digital competences are necessary in all aspects of life, whether they are social or personal, relate to labour or leisure, in any sector, public or private. Improved citizenship is the primary aim of developing digital competences. It is our conviction that the education and training on digital competences need a more consistent approach and a cohesive European system of delivery.

The Manifesto contains a series of key principles and recommendations under five main areas on how to maximise the impact of education and training, as powerful instruments towards a continuous development of digital competences for the European citizens:

1. The education and training offer
2. Access to education and training
3. Quality of education and training
4. European homogeneous validation
5. Sustainability and development

Recent technological innovation has had an enormous impact on both political and
organizational processes. The introduction of web technology, mobile phones, email and
social media has changed the way people work as well as how they participate in the civils
society. In politics, platforms like Rousseau, the possibility of real-time polling as well as the
personalization of political representation through social media has given citizens the
possibility of a more direct influence on political decision making. In organizations, emails,
websites and telecommunications have increased the speed of information exchange as
well as facilitated cooperation across borders and time zones.

Currently, both governments and organizations have been relying heavily on technology to
supress the pandemic and manage its consequences: apps with geolocalization to trace
infections and contacts, drones to control lockdowns, videoconferencing and the cloud to
facilitate home working. Technological innovation is being stimulated to help the world
mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic.

But what will happen after the pandemic? Will citizens have more influence on the political
decision making process thanks to technology? Or will governments disempower citizens
and use technology to keep them under control? In organizations, will employees be more
empowered to decide when, how and where to do their job? Or will the phones and emails
that already can reach anyone anytime anywhere result in more control by their hierarchy?

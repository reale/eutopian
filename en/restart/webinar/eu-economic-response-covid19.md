The EU financial support will be crucial for economic recovery in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemics. Member States have hailed the Recovery Fund as a victory for national politics, however it must be thought of as a tool to boost the EU's economics as a whole, not just a contingency help for individual needs. As President Ursula von der Leyen declared, “the recovery plan turns the immense challenge we face into an opportunity, not only by supporting the recovery but also by investing in our future: the European Green Deal and digitalization will boost jobs and growth, the resilience of our societies and the health of our environment”. A shared vision and a coordinated answer to the crisis are key to using financial instruments towards a common goal and to pave the way for a stronger, more united Europe.

During this webinar we will discuss about the measures adopted at EU level in response to the COVID19 crisis, the recently adopted Recovery Plan and the role of the EU Parliament in the area of EU Budget together with **Brando Benifei**, Member of the European Parliament.

The webinar will include a presentation by the speaker and a Q&A session.

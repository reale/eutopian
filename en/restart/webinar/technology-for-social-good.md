Identifying technology tools and strategies to help sustain and scale social impact, the webinar will cover everything from the gamification of education to the use of cross-sector collaborations to scale social programs internationally. It will also address the use of edtech to help vulnerable populations better respond to the scientific and mental health implications of COVID-19.

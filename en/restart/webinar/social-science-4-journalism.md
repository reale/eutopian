Social science has an amazing body of literature that covers every aspect of the public sphere. For a number of years, my professional goal has been to bridge the gap between this literature (particularly, comparative politics and NPL) and journalism. With ups and downs, this lecture wants to be a SWAT analysis of this kind of approach, with some historical leads on the origin of datajournalism and with an outlook for the future with a review of the tools modern datajournalists need to make their way in the business.

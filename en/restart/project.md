The **#Restart** project is made up of two interconnected initiatives:

* a series of webinars and live interviews ([2020](/en/restart/2020), [2021](/en/restart/2021)), on a weekly basis, on the basic themes of the Association and involving, to the greatest extent possible, Italian and international experts

* a [Decalogue](/en/restart/decalogue), intended as a collaborative document published on the Association's web portal at least in Italian and English and open to contributions from all social parties; at the end of a consultation period, the Decalogue will be consolidated and shared with national and European stakeholders

Furthermore, also for the purpose of coordinating the project, Eutopian has set up a Working Group on *innovation, enterprises, and public policies*, with special attention to the dimensions of sustainability (social, economic, environmental), information security and inter-regional and cross-border interoperability.

Through the #Restart project, [Eutopian joins the **Digital Republic** initiative](https://repubblicadigitale.innovazione.gov.it/iniziativa/restart/), by the Italian Ministry of Technological Innovation.

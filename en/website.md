We think highly of the open-source values and models, and this website is no exception: it is built built upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the whole source code is available through its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eutopian-eu/eutopian.eu), so as to allow everybody to collaborate.

The Jekyll theme is based on the [UI Kit](https://github.com/italia/design-ui-kit) and built with [Bootstrap Italia](https://github.com/italia/bootstrap-italia/), both of which are being continuously improved by the [Developer Italia](https://developers.italia.it/) community.

The site is powered by a [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/)-based continuous integration process and protected by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), whose [Project Galileo](https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo/) we are proudly part of.

Comments are implemented via [Disqus](https://disqus.com/), and are of course always welcome.

To the Next Generation EU, in the programming of the EU budget 2021-2027, additional funds will be added under the program [*DEP - Digital European Program*](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news / digital-europe-program-proposed-eu82-billion-funding-2021-2027). Five pillars are the subject of future European calls for digital transformation: Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Digital Skills, Supercomputing, Interoperability, for a total of approximately 8.2 billion.

Roberto Reale, president at Eutopian, talks about it in a focused way in this interview given to [CorCom](https://www.corrierecomunicazioni.it/la-videointervista/reale-eutopian-recovery-fund-chance-imperdibile-di-rilancio-ma- allitalia-serve-skills /), noting the winning features of projects destined to win tenders.

At Eutopian we work on the construction of inclusive digitization projects, the watchwords are: vision and competence.

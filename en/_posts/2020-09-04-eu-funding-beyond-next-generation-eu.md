Beyond the Next Generation EU, the EU budget 2021-2027 allocates additional funds as part of the [*DEP - Digital Europe Programme*](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-europe-programme-proposed-eu82-billion-funding-2021-2027). Spread over five major pillars (Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Digital Skills, High-Performance Computing, Interoperability), the forthcoming EU calls for digital trasformation are expected to total a whopping 8.2 billion.

Roberto Reale, president at Eutopian, discusses the most efficient moves for a successful europlanning strategy during an interview with [CorCom](https://www.corrierecomunicazioni.it/la-videointervista/reale-eutopian-recovery-fund-chance-imperdibile-di-rilancio-ma-allitalia-servono-competenze/).

At Eutopian, we strive to develop inclusive digitisation projects, building upon our key skills: vision and competence.

Through our [**#Restart**](/en/restart/project) project, Eutopian joins
[**Repubblica Digitale**](https://innovazione.gov.it/it/repubblica-digitale/),
a national national strategic initiative promoted by the **Department for
digital transformation** of the Italian **Presidency of the Council of
Ministers** and by the **Minister for technological innovation and
digitisation** with the aim of fighting the digital cultural divide throughout
Italy, of supporting maximum digital inclusion, and of encouraging education on
digital technologies.

As part of the "Italy 2025" strategy, the initiative aims to:

* reducing the phenomenon of digital illiteracy to levels comparable to those
  of the European countries of reference, fostering the development of the
  digital skills of workers;
* significantly increasing the percentage of ICT specialists experienced in
  emerging technologies reaching the levels of many other European countries.

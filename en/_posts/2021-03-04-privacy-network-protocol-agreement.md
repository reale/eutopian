Eutopian has signed a memorandum of understanding with [Privacy
Network](https://privacy-network.it/), an Italian non-profit organization that
promotes privacy, data protection, and fundamental rights in the digital world,
as a means to tackle the challenges of technological innovation.

Our collaboration will be developed through joining in working groups and
projects, raising public opinion and political awareness, organizing events and
training activities, and will be focused on issues of mutual interest, such as:

- Artificial Intelligence;
- Privacy;
- Cyber Security;
- Video surveillance;
- Awareness in the use of digital platforms;
- Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, Data Governance Act;
- Transparency and Open Government;
- Protection of fundamental rights in the digital world.

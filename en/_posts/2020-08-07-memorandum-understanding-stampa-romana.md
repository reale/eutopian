We have signed a new memorandum of understanding with [**Associazione Stampa Romana**](https://stamparomana.it/), the unitary union of journalists who practice their profession in accordance with the law and who reside or who carry out their business in Lazio, Italy. The protocol calls for a shared commitment to develop professional training courses on innovation, digital transformation, and European planning.

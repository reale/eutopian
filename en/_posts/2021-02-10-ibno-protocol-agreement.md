Eutopian has signed a protocol of agreement with the [**Italian Blockchain
National Observatory - IBNO**](https://www.ibno.eu/), a national initiative
born as part of a collaboration between the [**Department of Economics and

II**](http://www.demi.unina.it/),
[**Italia4Blockchain**](https://www.italia4blockchain.it/) and [**Cryptodiamond

with reports, scientific paper and courses, creating a shared platform capable
of connecting knowledge and experience at different levels (researchers,

The Italian newspaper [Open](https://www.open.online/) [interviews](https://www.open.online/2020/06/01/ecco-come-sara-immuni-app-per-contenere-i-contagi-del-coronavirus-nella-fase-2/) our president [Roberto Reale](/en/about-us/bio/roberto-reale) to glean a few insights about the software architecture of the Italian exposure notification app, Immuni. At the time of the interview, the app is not yet available and we had to rely exclusively on what could be deduced by examining the source code itself.

It was an important opportunity to clarify such oncepts as "source code" and "open source" which have entered Italian public debates thanks to Immuni.

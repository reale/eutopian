In times when cities and communities are looking to digital solutions to tackle a growing range of interconnected challenges, we must boost these efforts through a *European Way* where digital solutions help to create places where people enjoy living and working.

As Eutopian we endorsed and are fully committed to supporting the [Living in EU Declaration](https://www.living-in.eu/), promoted by [Eurocities](https://eurocities.eu/), [Open & Agile Smart Cities (OASC)](https://oascities.org/), [ENoLL (European Network of Living Labs)](https://enoll.org/), the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/) and [European Committee of the Regions](https://cor.europa.eu/).

All signatories agree on the following principles:

* a citizen-centric approach;
* a city-led approach at EU level;
* the city as a citizen-driven and open innovation ecosystem;
* ethical and socially responsible access, use, sharing and management of data;
* technologies as key enablers;
* interoperable digital platforms based on open standards and technical specifications, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and shared data models.

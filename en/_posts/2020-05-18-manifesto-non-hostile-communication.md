Eutopian officially endorses the [Manifesto of Non-Hostile
Communication](https://paroleostili.it/manifesto/?lang=en), a commitment of
shared responsibility to create a respectful and civilized Internet space that
represents us and offers a sense of security. Written and adopted by a
community of over 300 communicators, bloggers and influencers, it is a charter
of 10 practical principles guiding online behaviour.

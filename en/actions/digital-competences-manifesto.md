Eutopian endorses the [Digital Competences Manifesto](https://all-digital.org/manifesto/) developed by [ALL DIGITAL](https://all-digital.org/), an international association based in Brussels whose aim is the development of digital competences.

In full compliance with Eutopian's Statute, the Digital Competences Manifesto recognises tbat digital competences are necessary in all aspects of life, whether they are social or personal, relate to labour or leisure. Improved citizenship is the primary aim of developing digital competences.

The Digital Competences Manifesto was first proposed at the ALL DIGITAL General Assembly in May 2019, and after the extensive consultation was presented at the ALL DIGITAL Summit in Bologna on 11 October 2019.

The Manifesto contains a series of key principles and recommendations under five main areas on how to maximise the impact of education and training, as powerful instruments towards a continuous development of digital competences for the European citizens:

1. The education and training offer
2. Access to education and training
3. Quality of education and training
4. European homogeneous validation
5. Sustainability and development

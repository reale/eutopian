**Eutopian**'s public ID number in the Transparency Register is: [**950328639092-74**](https://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=950328639092-74&isListLobbyistView=true).

## Why a transparency register?

Since decisions taken by the EU affect millions of European citizens, they must be taken as openly as possible. The EU institutions interact with a wide range of groups and organisations representing specific interests. This is a legitimate and necessary part of the decision-making process to make sure that EU policies reflect citizens' real needs. The decision-making process must be transparent to allow for proper scrutiny and to ensure that the Union's institutions are accountable. The European Parliament and the European Commission are committed to being open about the groups and organisations with which they interact.

### The Register exists to answer questions such as:

-   What interests are being represented at EU level?

-   Who represents those interests, and on whose behalf?

-   With what budgets?

### The Register has the following key features:

-   A public website where organisations representing particular interests at EU level register and up-to-date information about those interests

-   A [Code of Conduct](http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/staticPage/displayStaticPage.do?reference=CODE_OF_CONDUCT&locale=en) governing relations of interest representatives with the EU institutions

-   [Alerts and complaints](http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/staticPage/displayStaticPage.do?reference=ALERTS_COMPLAINTS&locale=en) mechanism to enable anyone to trigger an administrative inquiry into information contained in the Register or suspected breaches of the Code by registered organisations or individuals

-   [Guidelines](http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/staticPage/displayStaticPage.do?reference=GUIDELINES&locale=en) for registrants and a helpdesk

The Register is managed by the ['Joint Transparency Register Secretariat (JTRS)'](http://ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/staticPage/displayStaticPage.do?reference=CONTACT_US&locale=en) comprising staff from Parliament and the Commission.

### Other tools

The Transparency Register is just one of the initiatives designed to make EU decision-making more open. The [Transparency portal](http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/index_en.htm) *(set up by the Commission in 2012)* provides access to tools for looking into:

-   How decisions are taken in the EU

-   Who takes part in decision-making

-   Public consultations

-   Who gets funding from the EU budget

-   What documents are held or produced in the process of drafting and adopting laws

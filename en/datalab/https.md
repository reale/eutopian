Adopting the [HTTPS protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) by the Public Administration websites is pivotal in guaranteeing confidentiality and protection of the user's personal data, as well as in protecting the very reputation of public bodies. In other words, it is a matter of mutual trust. But not all Italian public administrations are compliant.

Below is a list of Italian public service websites which offer the HTTPS connection and of those which do not offer it. The list is automatically (and periodically) generated from the [Public Administration Index](https://indicepa.gov.it/), at the time being only for the following categories of public bodies:
- Constitutional Bodies
- Presidency of the Council of Ministers, Ministries and State Advocacy

In a more advanced phase, the data will be made available for all the over 20 thousand Italian public administrations, and a notification function will also be implemented.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: the table only describes the *as is* status at the date and time of automatic verification.

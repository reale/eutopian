At Eutopian we are committed to engage policy makers throughout the EU on the new challenges, while providing governmental organisations and businesses alike guidance on the legal, financial and technological tools needed to successfully implement innovation. We team up with specialised companies and professionals to control innovation risk and ensure minimal disruption.

## Press review

Eutopian provides members with a daily press review on economics, innovation, sustainability, future of work.

## Development of project ideas

Submitting an innovative project on a European or national funding call is an activity that requires time and specialised knowledge. A careful preliminary evaluation of the idea and an adequate initial structuring save time and guarantee better results.

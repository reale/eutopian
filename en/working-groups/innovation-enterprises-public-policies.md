Eutopian has set up a **Working Group on innovation, enterprises, and public policies**, with special attention to the dimensions of sustainability (social, economic, environmental), information security and inter-regional and cross-border interoperability.

The Working Group aims at analysing good practices and proposing the development of useful models to be adopted or, where identified, to suggest improvements to be introduced in organizational models, processes and platforms.

The activity of the Working Group is to be understood in synergy with other national and community entities engaged in the same area.

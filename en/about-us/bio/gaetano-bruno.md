I like to call myself a *digital humanist*, since I to have acquired a good experience in document management over the years and in particular in the management of information sharing. The use of process and workflow design through the UML programming language and the functional logic model E-R has become over time for me the fundamental work tool.

As a project manager in public and private contexts I have managed innovation projects and since 2017 I collaborate with Agenzia per lâ€™Italia Digitale where I was first involved in the monitoring of the ICT contracts of the Public Administration and currently within the Document services transformation area I take part in the drafting of the new guidelines on the formation, management, and conservation of IT documents.

I participate in the working group dedicated to the creation of a logical network of conservation centres and the definition of the relative technical rules, with the aim of promoting application cooperation between public information systems. I have been teaching on the life cycle of the IT document and on data protection and IT security for the Master in "Digitization of the PA" of Il Sole 24 ORE Business School. I am hold Prince2, Cobit5, and ITIL certifications.

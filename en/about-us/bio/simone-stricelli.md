April 10, 1989: these are the only formalities. I was born as a creative among school desks. Partly out of spirit of escape, partly out my own disposition. After finishing high school I attended the MIT Open Courses where I learned the basics of strategic marketing and brand management declined on the digital sector.

At 18, I started working as a brand consultant for various creative industry agencies. I have never stopped since. For six years I worked as a brand strategy for some leading brands in their local and international sector.

Since then I have never stopped creating and in 2012 I created my agency. I am the creative director of [Kaos Communication](https://www.kaoscommunication.com/). Every day I work to help companies in the luxury, comfort, and startup sectors to cope with the needs of the public, using skills in strategic marketing and brand management.
